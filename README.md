# Image Filtering System in the Spatial Domain

## üìÑ Short Summary of the Project
This project implements an **Image Filtering System** that allows users to upload an image, apply Gaussian noise to it, and view the original and processed (blurred) images. The system demonstrates how image filtering techniques work by combining a Python backend for computations and a JavaScript-based frontend for interactivity. Users can select processing options, such as noise modeling and filter types, and view the results on a visually appealing interface.
